This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
# Set up data frame of monthly components 

```{r}
# Set path to target directory
setwd("C:/Home/Projects/GLWaterBudget/Analysis/Superior")

# source script to set up data files
source("Superior/src/work/setupMonthlyDataFrame.R")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
